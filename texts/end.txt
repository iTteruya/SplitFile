We had misunderstood. We were fools.
But, could anyone mock us for misunderstanding?
A drama that had its final episode determined wouldnt end until its final episode.
A movie that had a preview for its final instalment wouldnt end until its final instalment.
Everyone should have been living while believing that. They should have been taught as much.
I too had thought that.
I had had believed that a novel wouldnt end until its last page.
Perhaps she would laugh, saying that Id read too many novels.

Even though I had wanted to read it till the very end. Even though I had meant to read it.

The result of the mischief with the rope she was setting up too.
What she really thought of me too.
Id never be able to find out.
